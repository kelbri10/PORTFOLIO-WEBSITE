                Born and raised in Maryland, I graduated from UMBC in 2016 with my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology. First and foremost, I am an advocate. Mental Health and seeking equity for underrepresented communities are passions of mine. I have worked over 3 years in the Non-profit sector. My experiences there have cultivated me into the critical leader I am today.

                In 2020, I attended and completed a coding bootcamp hosted by John Hopkins University in 2020 with a focus in Full Stack Web Development.

                As a Software Engineer, my long-term goals are to create impactful web applications that help people form meaningful connections with one another. I desire to improve the quality of life of those around me. I want to strengthen communities by increasing accessibility to resources and information with the applications I build.
